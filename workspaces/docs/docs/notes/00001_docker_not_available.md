## Error

Sometimes during deployment, it may be reported that Docker is not installed although Docker is installed in the system.

## Fix

This can happen after Docker has updated itself. It is caused by the `docker` command not being recognised. This is usually fixed by restarting the system. If that does not help, see if the `docker` command is available in your command line and investigate different strategies suggested by Docker to fix it.
