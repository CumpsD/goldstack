All Goldstack templates contain Terraform Infrastructure as Code definitions. Goldstack provides easy tooling to stand up this infrastructure. Terraform will use the _AWS credentials_ configured as per the instructions above.

All state will be stored in [Terraform S3 remote state using DynamoDB locking](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html). Goldstack will automatically create a bucket for storing the state in the same AWS account that the infrastructure is deployed to (thus being able to use the same AWS credentials).

During standing up the infrastructure for the first package of a project, Goldstack will create the `config/infra/aws/terraform.json` file that contains the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for all packages deployed to a respective AWS account. Below an example `terraform.json` file.

```json
{
  "remoteState": [
    {
      "user": "dev",
      "terraformStateBucket": "goldstack-tfstate-67a73e60720c25855a39baeb1218b55229578671",
      "terraformStateDynamoDBTable": "goldstack-tfstate-a82076777995c7254fbcae1f9e8013fee75833f2-lock"
    },
    {
      "user": "prod",
      "terraformStateBucket": "goldstack-tfstate-0cb1a35a83c9c952321ee4addbe76d096b031d47",
      "terraformStateDynamoDBTable": "goldstack-tfstate-0cb1a35a83c9c957772ee4addbe76d096b031d47-lock"
    }
  ]
}
```

To prevent Goldstack from auto-generating the bucket and table names, provide a `terraform.json` file before standing up the infrastructure for your first package. Goldstack will create bucket and table using the names you specify then. Also, if you have special requirements for your bucket and table, you can create these before standing up the infrastructure with Goldstack. You only need to ensure that the bucket and table fulfil the requirements of Terraform for storing its remote state.

All packages included in a project will use the same bucket and DynamoDB table. The name of the state file will be defined in the `goldstack.json` file within each package.

```json
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/package.schema.json",
  "name": "mypackage",
  "deployments": [
    {
      "name": "dev",
      "tfStateKey": "mypackage-dev-f53056a8788c8eb7a1ac.tfstate"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `tfStateKey` property is defined before running `yarn infra init [deployment]`, Goldstack will use the name specified as key for the state in bucket and DynamoDB table. If the `tfStateKey` property is not defined, a name will be generated and `goldstack.json` updated.

Ensure that after standing up infrastructure for the first time to commit and push changes to your project, since Goldstack will update `goldstack.json` config and the `config/infra/aws/terraform.json` config. This is only required for initialising the infrastructure for each package and target AWS account (and if you do not provide the names for bucket, table and state files manually). For subsequent updates to the infrastructure it is not necessary to update the source files.
