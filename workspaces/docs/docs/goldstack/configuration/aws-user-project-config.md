Goldstack provides tools to set up the infrastructure of your project on AWS. You can provide credentials below that will be used on your development machine.

If you do not know how to get the _Access Key ID_ and _Secret Access Key_, please find [instructions here](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/goldstack/configuration#how-to-get-aws-credentials).

Credentials can be provided in a number of other ways as well, such as by running `aws login` locally. For all options, please see [AWS Configuration](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/goldstack/configuration#aws-configuration).
