The Lambda API template provides a template for defining an API using the [AWS API Gateway HTTP API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api.html). It is designed to allow for rapid development with minimal configuration by defining API routes using folders and source files similar to the way APIs are defined in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction).
