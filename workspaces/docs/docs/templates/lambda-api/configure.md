The following key properties need to be configured for this template:

- **Lambda Name Prefix**: The prefix to be used by [Lambda names](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/API_CreateFunction.html#SSS-CreateFunction-request-FunctionName) generated by this template for the defined routes.
- **API Domain**: The domain where the API should be deployed to. For instance, to be able to call the API endpoint `https://api.mydomain.com/` the API domain `api.mydomain.com` needs to be configured.
- **Hosted Zone Domain**: A Route 53 hosted zone that will allow adding the _API Domain_ as a record. For instance, in order to configure the API domain `api.mydomain.com`, the hosted zones `api.mydomain.com` or `mydomain.com` would be valid. For more details, please check [Hosted Zone Configuration](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/goldstack/configuration#hosted-zone-configuration) in the Goldstack documentation.
- **CORS Header**: An optional CORS header to enable a UI that is hosted on a different domain to access this API. For instance, for a UI that is deployed to the domain `ui.mydomain.com` the CORS header `https://ui.mydomain.com` should be supplied. To learn more about CORS, see the [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) in the MDN docs.
