# About

Getting started with a new project often takes so much longer than it should. Rather than writing code for the problem we want to solve, we fiddle around with the tooling. This problem is often substantial especially in JavaScript ecosystems, where getting common tools such as ESLint, TypeScript, Jest and React work together takes a lot of time and can be frustrating.

Goldstack provides high quality starter projects that are configured based on best practices and sensible defaults. Using a Goldstack starter project rather than a hand-rolled one, will save you dozens of development hours. Moreover, at Goldstack we obsess with every detail of our starter projects and have the freedom to spend the time on optimizing things; something often lost in the race to get sprint goals delivered in many development projects.

## Design Principles

Goldstack templates are based on the following design principles:

### Only the best tech

We aim to provide starter templates for the best frameworks currently on the market. All modules on Goldstack are based on frameworks and solutions with proven track records for productivity and stability.

### Professional

Goldstack templates allow your project to lift off at rocket speed while being sufficiently robust and configurable to fit the requirements of a professional environment. We enable this by:

*   All infrastructure is defined in Terraform and can be modified to fit into your environments
*   Everything can be deployed in AWS
*   We provide instructions for security hardening for every template

### Serverless

Goldstack templates use Serverless technologies unlocking the benefits of rapid development cycles, security, observability and low ongoing costs. Following some examples of ways Serverless technologies are employed for the templates:

*   Any frontends are deployed using AWS S3 and CloudFront
*   Our Express server template is wrapped in a Lambda
*   Our email template utilizes AWS Simple Email Service for email sending

### Unlimited customizability

We all know that there is usually a trade off in platforms that help us get something done quickly such as when using Firebase. It is very easy to develop and deploy a simple application. However, it is often difficult to adapt the initial simple project to our specific needs. Goldstack is based on the premise that there should not a be a limit to what you can do with your project. Some of the elements that enable this are:

*   Infrastructure can be adapted to your needs utilizing the full power of Terraform
*   Core functionality is defined as easy to change source code in the project
*   Any dependencies we add to your project are available as open source and open for you to modify as required

### Modularity first

Modularity is one of the most important principles in software design. Unfortunately it is often difficult in the JavaScript ecosystem to develop truly modular applications. Many projects have started to adopt Lerna for this purpose, but Lerna comes with its own problems, especially for larger projects.

*   Utilizing Yarn 2 for efficient workspace management
*   Providing TypeScript APIs for connecting modules; for instance a backend module can simply import an S3 module and use TypeScript methods to establish a connection to the bucket

### Built to be Tested

Automated testing is a key driver for software quality but, while modern frameworks make it easy to write unit tests for individual components, it is often difficult to establish end-to-end tests that cover the entire stack of an application. Goldstack modules are optimized to allow writing tests that cover all modules of an application. For instance, it is possible to write a Jest test that uses React Testing Library to walk through the user interface while interacting with an in-memory API server (rather than having to mock calls to the backend).

# Configuration

It can often be overwhelming to start working with a new starter project. If you provide us with some details about your project, we can generate a baseline configuration for deployment to AWS.

The following properties are required for general project configuration:

*   **Project Name**: A name for this project.
*   **Deployment**: Choose if you want to use the configuration tool to configure production or development infrastructure. At this point, the configuration tool only supports definition of either production or development infrastructure. However, after you download your project, you can configure unlimited additional deployment configurations (for example if you choose to define development infrastructure now, you can define production infrastructure later).
*   **AWS Region**: The [AWS region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/#:~:text=AWS%20maintains%20multiple%20geographic%20Regions,Africa%2C%20and%20the%20Middle%20East.) infrastructure that your project should be deployed to.

## AWS Configuration

Goldstack provides ready-made scripts to deploy your infrastructure to AWS. You can supply AWS credentials during project configuration that will be included in your downloaded package. By default, these will not be committed to source control.

However, there are many other ways in which AWS user credentials can be supplied for Goldstack, so providing the details during project configuration is optional. It is only recommended to do so for development systems.

If you do not know how to get the *Access Key ID* and *Secret Access Key*, please find [instructions here](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/goldstack/configuration#how-to-get-aws-credentials).

### How to get AWS Credentials

\[Video: Step-by-step Video Guide]\(https://www.youtube.com/embed/-lWrkpzEgfs)

The easiest way to configure the AWS user for Goldstack is to do it during project setup by providing an *AWS Access Key Id* and *AWS Secret Access Key*. To obtain these, please do the following:

*   Create an AWS account if you do not already have one. See [instructions on this from AWS here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
*   Open the AWS console IAM management and sign in if required: <https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home>
*   Click on *Users* in the menu on the right

![Add User in AWS console](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/add_user.png)

*   Provide a username of your choice, for instance 'goldstack-local-dev'
*   Select the Access Type *Programmatic Access*

![Provide user details](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/user_details.png)

*   Click on the button *Next: Permissions*
*   Select *Attach existing policies directly*
*   Select the Policy *Administrator Access*

![Select permissions](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/permissions.png)

*   Click on the button *Next: Tags*
*   You do not have to add any tags, just click *Next: Review*
*   On the review page click *Create User*

Now you can copy the *Access Key ID* and add it to the Goldstack configuration form. Do the same with the *Secret Access Key* (It can be shown by clicking on Show).

![Obtain access keys](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/keys.png)

Note that it is recommended to only provide this key and secret for development systems (and prototype/hobby production systems). For all other systems, it is recommended to provide this key and secret only through environment variables (see below).

### Credentials in Config File

AWS credentials can be configured during project set up. However if you do not want to provide your credentials in the configuration tool or you want to change them later, they can be configured through a configuration file. This file can be found under the following paths:

```bash
config/infra/aws/config.json
```

The configuration file can have contents as follows:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "name": "dev-user",
      "type": "apiKey",
      "config": {
        "awsAccessKeyId": "[Your Access Key ID]",
        "awsSecretAccessKey": "[Your Secret Access Key]",
        "awsDefaultRegion": "[Region for user]"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "prod-user",
      "type": "apiKey",
      "config": {
        "awsAccessKeyId": "[Your Access Key ID]",
        "awsSecretAccessKey": "[Your Secret Access Key]",
        "awsDefaultRegion": "[Region for user]"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Make sure that the `"name"` property matches the `"awsUser"` of module deployments for which the user should be used. There is no limit to how many users you can define.

Note that we recommend that this file is *not* checked into source control. By default, there is a `.gitignore` file present in the `config/infra/aws` folder that will prevent this file from being checked into git.

If you want to supply AWS user credentials in your CI/CD systems, these can be supplied using environment variables.

### Credentials in Environment Variables

Goldstack can read AWS *Access Key ID* and *Secret Access Key* from environment variables. The easiest way is to set the following environment variables:

```bash
AWS_USER_NAME: [Your user name]
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: [Your access key id]
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: [Your secret access key]
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: [User region]
```

The `AWS_USER_NAME` variable is optional but can be useful for explicitly referencing the correct Goldstack user in deployments. The above setup is particularly useful for CI/CD environments. For instance, when using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/actions), environment variables could be configured as follows:

```yaml
- name: Deploy UI
  run: |
    yarn workspace my-ui deploy dev
  env:
    AWS_USER_NAME: dev-user
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: ${{secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: ${{secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}
    AWS_DEFAULT_REGION: us-west-2
```

Where the values of the environment variables are defined in [GitHub Secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets).

## Hosted Zone Configuration

\[Video: Video Guide]\(https://www.youtube.com/embed/9rug-hhkxSc)

Many modules need to deploy resources to a domain, for instance for a [static website](./../modules/static-website-aws) or for an [API server](./../modules/lambda-express). Goldstack modules can provide the DNS configuration required but you need to specify the [Route 53 hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html) that the DNS entries should be added to. You can either use an already existing hosted zone or create a new one.

### Creating a new hosted zone

The following steps describe how to create a new hosted zone in AWS Route 53.

*   (Optional) If you haven't registered a domain, you can [register a domain through Route 53](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/domain-register.html).
*   Go to the [Route 53 AWS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones#)
*   Click on *Create Hosted Zone*

![Create hosted zone](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/create_hosted_zone.png)

*   Provide the name of a domain you own (or a subdomain of a domain you own) and click *Create hosted zone*.

![Provide hosted zone details](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/hosted_zone_details.png)

*   If you haven't registered your domain through Route 53, configure your domain with your domain registrar to use the nameservers Route 53 lists for your domain.

![Provide hosted zone details](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/nameservers.png)

Now you can copy the domain name of your hosted zone and provide this in your module configuration

![Domain name to be used for module configuration](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/domainname.png)

Note that for the actual domain your module uses, you can specify the domain name of the hosted zone directly, or one of it's subdomains. For instance, if your hosted zone domain is `yourdomain.com` you can configure a website module to be deployed to `yourdomain.com` or `website.yourdomain.com`.

You can use the same hosted zone for multiple modules. Just make sure to use subdomains to avoid conflicts between modules. For instance, if you configure a website to be deployed to `mydomain.com` then deploy your API to `api.mydomain.com`.

### Using an existing hosted zone

If you already have a hosted zone configured for the domain you would like to use for your module, you simply need to provide the domain of the hosted zone.

*   You can find all hosted zones you have configured in the [Route 53 Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/v2/hostedzones#)
*   Copy the value provided under *Domain name* and provide this in your module configuration

![Determining domain name from hosted zone list](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/domainname_list.png)

## Terraform

All Goldstack templates contain Terraform Infrastructure as Code definitions. Goldstack provides easy tooling to stand up this infrastructure. Terraform will use the *AWS credentials* configured as per the instructions above.

All state will be stored in [Terraform S3 remote state using DynamoDB locking](https://www.terraform.io/docs/language/settings/backends/s3.html). Goldstack will automatically create a bucket for storing the state in the same AWS account that the infrastructure is deployed to (thus being able to use the same AWS credentials).

During standing up the infrastructure for the first package of a project, Goldstack will create the `config/infra/aws/terraform.json` file that contains the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table for all packages deployed to a respective AWS account. Below an example `terraform.json` file.

```json
{
  "remoteState": [
    {
      "user": "dev",
      "terraformStateBucket": "goldstack-tfstate-67a73e60720c25855a39baeb1218b55229578671",
      "terraformStateDynamoDBTable": "goldstack-tfstate-a82076777995c7254fbcae1f9e8013fee75833f2-lock"
    },
    {
      "user": "prod",
      "terraformStateBucket": "goldstack-tfstate-0cb1a35a83c9c952321ee4addbe76d096b031d47",
      "terraformStateDynamoDBTable": "goldstack-tfstate-0cb1a35a83c9c957772ee4addbe76d096b031d47-lock"
    }
  ]
}
```

To prevent Goldstack from auto-generating the bucket and table names, provide a `terraform.json` file before standing up the infrastructure for your first package. Goldstack will create bucket and table using the names you specify then. Also, if you have special requirements for your bucket and table, you can create these before standing up the infrastructure with Goldstack. You only need to ensure that the bucket and table fulfil the requirements of Terraform for storing its remote state.

All packages included in a project will use the same bucket and DynamoDB table. The name of the state file will be defined in the `goldstack.json` file within each package.

```json
{
  "$schema": "./schemas/package.schema.json",
  "name": "mypackage",
  "deployments": [
    {
      "name": "dev",
      "tfStateKey": "mypackage-dev-f53056a8788c8eb7a1ac.tfstate"
    }
  ]
}
```

If the `tfStateKey` property is defined before running `yarn infra init [deployment]`, Goldstack will use the name specified as key for the state in bucket and DynamoDB table. If the `tfStateKey` property is not defined, a name will be generated and `goldstack.json` updated.

Ensure that after standing up infrastructure for the first time to commit and push changes to your project, since Goldstack will update `goldstack.json` config and the `config/infra/aws/terraform.json` config. This is only required for initialising the infrastructure for each package and target AWS account (and if you do not provide the names for bucket, table and state files manually). For subsequent updates to the infrastructure it is not necessary to update the source files.

# Getting Started

This page describes what you can do once you have downloaded your starter project. You will be able to download your project after selecting modules and having configured them on the Goldstack website. Please see [How Does It Work](./how-does-it-work) for more details.

The video guides below cover all the steps that are described on this page:

\[Video: Quick Video Guide (3:53 min)]\(https://www.youtube.com/embed/hvZ8Ry9XYVE)

## 1. Install dependencies

Goldstack requires a few dependencies to be available in your development system. Please verify they are present or install them:

*   Node v12+: [Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
*   Yarn v1.22.5+: [Yarn Installation](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
*   Docker v19+: [Install Docker for Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/) / [Install Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)

### Confirm versions

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
node -v
yarn -v
docker --version
```

See the required versions above.

## 2. Extract and install

Extract the contents of the zip file into a folder of your choice. After you have done that, you must initialise the project. Simply run the following in your project directory:

```bash
yarn
```

The installation process should take around 3-10 minutes depending on the modules you have selected and your Internet speed.

You can confirm everything was installed correctly by running:

```bash
yarn -v
```

Which should show a yarn version of 2.0.0+.

## 3. Build modules

Make sure that everything builds correctly by running the following in your project directory:

```bash
yarn build
```

## 4. Configure VSCode

Your project should come with all files required to configure VSCode. Configuration files are in the `.vscode/` folder. Simply open the folder of your project in VSCode. If you are asked to allow the installation of additional extensions, please confirm to install them.

If you want to install the necessary extensions manually, here are links to the extensions required:

*   [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
*   [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
*   [ZipFS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=arcanis.vscode-zipfs) (optional)

Try to find any `.ts` file in your project. They should be present in one of your modules under `packages/*/src/`.

Once you open a `.ts` file, VSCode should open a confirmation at the bottom right corner of the screen asking *This workspace contains a TypeScript version. Would you like to use the workspace TypeScript version for TypeScript and JavaScript language features?*. Confirm this by clicking the *Allow* button.

![Allow TypeScript](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/allow_typescript.png)

In the status bar on the bottom righthand corner of the VSCode editor you should now see *TypeScript* along with a version such as *3.9.5-pnpify*.

![VSCode status bar](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/vscode_status_bar.png)

If the confirmation dialog does not show up or the version that you see does not include *pnpify*, click the version number next to *TypeScript*. Then select the TypeScript version from the list that includes *pnpify*.

![Select TypeScript version](https://cdn.goldstack.party/img/202010/select_typescript_version.png)

## 5. Deploy modules (Optional)

If you have [configured your project for AWS deployment](./configuration) on Goldstack before downloading the project, all modules should be ready to be deployed to AWS. We recommend going through each of your modules individually to ensure the infrastructure for them can be deployed successfully. Please see the getting started guides for the templates you have chosen for instructions. You should have received an email that contains links to the relevant getting started guides.

## 6. Develop

Each module you have selected comes with its own instructions about how to get started with development. However, there are some handy commands in the project root that can be useful for development:

*   `yarn build`: Will build all modules in the project.
*   `yarn compile:watch`: Will watch for any changes in your TypeScript files in all modules, and compile them when required. It is essential to have this command running if you develop TypeScript libraries or supporting modules such as [S3](../modules/s3) or [Email Send](./../modules/email-send).
*   `yarn test:watch`: Will run tests when modules have changed.

Note that you can run all of these commands in the context of individual modules as well. If you only modify code within one module, this is sufficient. However, if you develop multiple modules at the same time, it is important to run these commands at the project root.

# Security Hardening

Goldstack modules provide a balance between usability and security. If you have heightened security requirements, you can easily configure the modules for more security. Simply follow the documentation below or the documentation provided with your modules.

### AWS

The biggest trade-off made in all AWS modules is that there are no restrictive policies and permissions configured. Instead, many resources are simply given admin rights to all components of the system. This is similar to how resources would work in vanilla Kubernetes and works well for small applications and for initial greenfield development. We also recommend that within larger organisations, Goldstack projects should be deployed to dedicated AWS accounts (for further reading see [AWS Organisations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/)) whenever possible.

However, for workloads that are more security sensitive we recommend setting more restrictive policies. This must be done on a per-module basis. Please see the module documentation provided for the modules you have selected for specific instructions (links to relevant module documentation should have been sent to you via email).
