### '502 ERROR The request could not be satisfied' when opening page

Instead of seeing the page, you may see an error message like the following:

```
502 ERROR
The request could not be satisfied.
The Lambda function returned invalid json: The json output must be an object type. We can't connect to the server for this app or website at this time. There might be too much traffic or a configuration error. Try again later, or contact the app or website owner.
If you provide content to customers through CloudFront, you can find steps to troubleshoot and help prevent this error by reviewing the CloudFront documentation.

```

This is most likely due to the deployment not having worked correctly. Try deploying the package again with `yarn deploy [deploymentName]`.
