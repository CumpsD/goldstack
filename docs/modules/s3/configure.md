In order to provide a basic configuration for an S3 bucket, we only need to know the name of the bucket you want to create.

Please note that a bucket name needs to be [globally unique](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingBucket.html). However, buckets are always created in a specific [AWS region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html#concepts-regions). The bucket will be deployed to the AWS region you have specified.
