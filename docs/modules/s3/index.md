## Security Hardening

The S3 bucket for this module is already configured to allow only private access to the bucket. Be careful when making the bucket public and ensure that it only has contents that can be publicly exposed. For use cases such as using a bucket for hosting content, we recommend using the [Static Website](./static-website-aws) module.
