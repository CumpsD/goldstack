Goldstack provides ready-made scripts to deploy your infrastructure to AWS. You can supply AWS credentials during project configuration that will be included in your download package. These, by default, will not be committed to source control.

However, there are many other ways in which AWS user credentials can be supplied for Goldstack, so providing the details during project configuration is optional. It is only recommended to do so for development systems.

If you do not know how to get the _Access Key ID_ and _Secret Access Key_, please find [instructions here](https://docs.goldstack.party/docs/goldstack/configuration#how-to-get-aws-credentials).
