It can often be overwhelming to start working with a new starter project. If you provide us with some details about your project, we can generate a baseline configuration for you.

The following properties are required for general project configuration:

- **Project Name**: A name for this project.
- **Deployment**: Choose if you want to use the configuration tool to configure production or development infrastructure. At this point, the configuration tool only supports definition of either production or development infrastructure. However, after you download your project, you can configure unlimited additional deployment configurations (for example if you choose to define development infrastructure now, you can define production infrastructure later).
- **AWS Region**: The [AWS region](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/#:~:text=AWS%20maintains%20multiple%20geographic%20Regions,Africa%2C%20and%20the%20Middle%20East.) infrastructure for your project should be deployed to.
