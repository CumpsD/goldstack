### Configure through console

The easiest way to configure the AWS user for Goldstack to use is to do it during project setup by providing an _AWS Access Key Id_ and _AWS Secret Access Key_. To obtain these, please do the following:

- Create an AWS account if you do not already have one. See [instructions on this from AWS here](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/).
- Open the AWS console IAM management and sign in if required: https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-east-1#/home
- Click on _Users_ in the menu on the right
